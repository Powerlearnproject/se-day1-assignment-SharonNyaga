#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Enginering is the applications of enginerring principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems
Importance: it enables creation of software applications and systems

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages e.g.Fortran,C
Emerging of Methodologies - Software engineering methodologies provided structured frameworks for managing and executing software projects. Traditional models like the Waterfall model paved the way for more iterative and agile methods, improving development efficiency and quality
Recognition of a disciplined approach - In the late 1960s, key figures like Edsger Dijkstra, Fred Brooks, and Donald Knuth shaped the field by emphasizing a disciplined approach to software development. This recognition led to the establishment of software engineering as a discipline, akin to traditional engineering fields

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements -  Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design - Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation - the development of the project where code is intergtated
Testing - it is the checking of the quality of code, components and adherance of requirements which should meet the set standards 
Deployment - this is whereby the release of the developed software to the customers.
Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a Sequential approach with distinct phases eg. for where the poject requirements are clear and stable
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Agile would be appropriate for technical projects

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer, is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer, ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
project Manager, oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs, Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g. Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
VCS, Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g. Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements. - one can overcome it by having effective communication
Tight Deadlines. - one can overcome by utilizing agile methodologies and prioritization of tasks
Technical debt. -one can oveercome by having proper financial budgeting 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
Importance: Prompt engineering helps avoid getting confusing answers by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: Tell me about Kenya
Clear prompt: Tell me about the transition of Kenyan esucation system from 8-4-4 to CBC
The AI understood my prompt better and will provide the specific details
